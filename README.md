# SDP_partialinfo
Semidefinite program (SDP) to certify metrological usefulness as quantified by the quantum Fisher information (QFI), from experimentally-accesible statistics. Official code of the work [https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12711](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12711).

Kindly refer to the article for a detailed analysis of the methods discussed and their advantages and disadvantages.

1. We compare the different SDP methods in the Appendix A.3 of the paper and C.1 with TÃ³th's SDP method and the advantages and disadvantages of each of them in the [SDP_comparison](SDP_comparison.py) code file.

2. We check the effect of a finite $\delta\theta$ in our proposed SDP approach which can be seen in [Finite_dtheta](Finite_dtheta.py) file.

3. Using our SDP method in different examples such as [One-axis twisting dynamics](Oneaxistwisting.py), [Dicke-states](Dicke_states.py), and [spin chain systems](Spinchain.py).

4. Finally, we have the [Plots_data](Plots_data.py) file to plot the figures for the one-axis twisting dynamics case with the data present in the [Data](Data) folder, labelled as [linearSS_10,30](Data/linearSS_10,30) and [nonlinearSS_10,30](Data/nonlinearSS_10,30) for system sizes from N = 10 to 30.

5. We have rest of the data for the Dicke states analysis, spin-chain system, and comparison with the two proposed SDP methods in the [Data](Data).

6. The plots used in the article can be found in the [Plots](Plots).
